        <h1>Pentagon defends US troops who searched for slain soldier missing in Niger</h>

          <p>Senior Pentagon officials on Thursday defended the small team of American troops targeted
            in a deadly ambush earlier this month in Africa, an incident that has raised questions about
            why a slain soldier was not recovered for two days.
            The Oct. 4 operation in Niger, now under U.S. military investigation, resulted in
            the deaths of four Special Forces soldiers. One was Sgt. La David Johnson, whose remains
            were not located until Oct. 6. It’s highly unusual for that much time to pass before
            a slain soldier is recovered. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis suggested there were extenuating
            circumstances at play.

            Confusion over what happened during an ambush of U.S. Special Forces in Niger earlier this month
            apparently sparked a full Pentagon probe of the incident announced Thursday, which some officials say
            could have had even worse casualties than four American soldiers killed from the small, "out-matched" team.
            Officials have described a harrowing burst of violence in or near a village close to Niger's border with
            Mali on Oct. 4, which led to the first U.S. combat deaths in the small African nation battling Islamist
            extremists.

            The gunfight may have split the team of a dozen or fewer American commandos in half, according to one
            counterterrorism official. It was so chaotic that one soldier remained missing for up to 36 hours before
            his remains were recovered.  US military launches formal investigation into Niger ambush that
            killed 4 soldiers.

            <h3>Why US troops are in Niger</h3>

            "They met an overwhelming force,” the counterterrorism official who was familiar with the mission
            and its aftermath, told ABC News. “They were out-gunned and out-matched. The enemy had relative
            superiority in numbers and fully enveloped and out-flanked the team. I think they got cut in half
            with suppressive fire.”
            Four U.S. special operations soldiers were killed in action, along with 1 Nigerien soldier killed and two Americans wounded.

Another U.S. official said that the Defense Intelligence Agency has assessed it "highly likely" that the group of 50 or more attackers behind the ambush in Niger were from ISIS in the Greater Sahara, referred to as ISGS. But the
counterterrorism official said the attackers may have included current or former members of al-Qaeda-affiliated Islamist extremist group Ansar Dine from neighboring Mali.

Some of the special operations soldiers on the team -- who numbered less than a dozen
Americans -- had entered a remote village near Niger's border with Mali to conduct a routine
"key leader engagement" with elders, leaving the other U.S. soldiers some distance away with their vehicles,
when they all were targeted in a blistering attack, officials told ABC News.

One counterterrorism official said the team's approved primary mission on Oct. 4, the day of the attack,
was to scout for a base camp used by Islamist militants and the stop to meet with village elders was a secondary
 objective.

It remains unclear even to those in special operations with visibility over the mission gone
 awry what happened to Army Sgt. La David Johnson, a 3rd Special Forces Group support soldier who
 was missing for more than 20 hours and the subject of a frantic search by the U.S. military.

At some point a radio beacon Johnson was wearing was activated but it was overhead imagery scans
which enabled special operations analysts to locate his visible remains near the site of the clash,
said an official familiar with the search and rescue operation.
